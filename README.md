# Sprig-Projects
A list of more advanced projects that Ive built with my sprig.

--- 

These projects will probably be using CircuitPython 9.x.x with a raspberry pi pico w added to my sprig
https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico_w/

You can download this to your pico for its firmware and then add my code to your sprig by opening the file and copying both main.py and lib folders.
However do note this is a work in progress and may cause issues.
